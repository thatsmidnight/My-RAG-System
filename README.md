# Tabletop RPG AI RAG Assistant

This is a simple AI assistant for tabletop RPGs. It is designed to help game masters (GMs) and players by providing a simple interface to generate random encounters, NPCs, and other game elements. The assistant is built using the RAG framework, which is a powerful tool for generating text using a combination of pre-trained language models and reinforcement learning.

The LLM used is Google's `gemini-1.5-flash` model, which is a large language model trained on a diverse range of text data. The model is leveraged in a RAG framework to generate text based on user prompts and context from PDF rulebooks.
